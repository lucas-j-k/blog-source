Website built with Node and Express, to allow me to play around with HTML + CSS layouts and themes.

Each theme is a self contained part of the overall site, with its own routing file, asset folders and view folder, to enable each to be independent. This allows me to treat each page as a separate entity, enabling each to have its own page structure.

I wanted to have a place to store and host any little sample pages I create to work out ideas, play with different libraries or try out new CSS / Javascript techniques.
