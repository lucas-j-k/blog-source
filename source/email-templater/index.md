A full stack Laravel app, designed to make it easier to store email templates made of reusable text snippets, and provide a drag and drop interface for composing them.

Intended to streamline the emailing process for people who find themselves repeatedly sending similar emails.

The app implements user authentication, and connects to a database on the backend, and uses Javascript to power the main interface.

Styled with Bootstrap 4.
